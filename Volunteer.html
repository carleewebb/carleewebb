<h1>Aspirations!</h1>
  <h2>I love helping people, whether it be to help the less fortunate or just helping people that was the fix the area around them, seeing the smile on peoples faces when someone goes out of their wasy to do something for someone is what i do it for.  I also really love kids. They are so energetic and are even brutally honest (which can be kind of hurtful at times.) but its nothing i would chose to live without.<br> I want to use my love of kids and helping people in my furture career to make this world, or even just the place around me, better. My goal is to do something where it is truly centered around kids and i amm able to have some kind of impact on their lives.<h2>
