<h2>My name is Carlee Rena Webb and i am currently 15 years old. I am a sophomore at Madison Academic Highschool.<br> My freshman year i played tennis for our school team, but soon quit this year to focus on other oppertunities i only have in the spring. <br>I enjoy hanging out with friends and traveling more than anything and i am so thankful that i have friends that are willing to do it with me. <br>I never invisioned me taking coding a year ago, heck, not even back in december, but it is actually one of my favorite classes ive had.</h2>

My parents seperated back in October and i haad a lot of doubts, i never had a relationshipp with god, but i figured "what could go wrong?"</h2>
