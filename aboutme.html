  <h1>About Me!</h1>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">My name is Carlee Rena Webb and i am currently 15 years old. I am a sophomore at Madison Academic Highschool.<br> My freshman year i played tennis for our school team, but soon quit this year to focus on other
    oppertunities i only have in the spring. Some of my favorite things to do is go to soccer games, hangout/travel with my friiends, and hangout with my family. Family is very important to me and i hope in the furture to have a big and strong
    one. I never invisioned myself taking coding a year ago, heck, not even back in december, but it is actually one of my favorite classes ive had. It lets me see the behind the scenes of how websites work, and its so eye opening to see how much
    work goes into websites.</h2>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">As i said before, i LOVE traveling, but i dont get to it too often because, well, im 15 and dont have money. <br> Here is a list of some of my favorite things ive done!</h3>
  <h4 style="text-align: center;">Went to Ohio! I know its not anything great, but i just love being in that type of enviornment thats busy but not too crowded.</h4>
  <h4 style="text-align: center; margin-right: -290px;">There is this place in St. Louis, MO, that i love and its called the city museum and and it is basically an adult playground. I love it!</h4>
